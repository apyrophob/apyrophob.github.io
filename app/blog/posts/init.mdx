I was supposed to study physics today, but I couldn’t focus.
The words just blurred together, meant nothing.
So I opened a note instead and started writing whatever came to mind.

Lately I’ve been thinking about my blog, the one I still haven’t finished the first post for (I'm not lazy btw).
I stopped halfway because I started doubting what I was writing.
My ideas weren’t backed by facts, sources, or studies.
They were just mine.
Raw thoughts from my own head.

Maybe that’s the point, though.
Maybe this blog isn’t about proving anything.
Maybe it’s just a place where I try to gather the noise inside my head and shape it into something that makes sense, even if only to me.

I like the idea of being a “creator”.
The thought that something I write could reach someone, change their day, make them feel less alone.
But at the same time, I’m afraid, afraid my words might be wrong, naive, or simply laughed at.

Still, I think I’d rather be misunderstood than silent.
So here I am, writing.
This is my best attempt in trying to understand myself and the world.

To be continued...
